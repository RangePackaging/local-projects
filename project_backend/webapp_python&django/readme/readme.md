1. DJANGO
    NB: For a request to yield a response from a server we use backend programming languages like (python or php) to program the server.
    Coding this backend program is extremely difficult and thats where DJANGO FRAMEWORK comes in the picture
    Django gives us some predefine COMPONENTS or FUCNTIONS TO PROGRAM the backend server so that we dont have to reinvent the wheel to program the server from scratch.

    Its a free and open source web application backend framework that is used to build WEB APPLICATION ON THE SERVER NOT ON THE DESKTOP.

    Django also creates an automatic admin interface which supports CRUD.

2. Framework: a collection of components (prewritten codes) that helps us build sites faster

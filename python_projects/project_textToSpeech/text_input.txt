You call me Child, and I call you Father 
Kisses from Heaven
Shower joy and laughter.
You call me Lovely, and I call you Faithful
You there in my weakness
My strength for tomorrow.

You call me Friend, and I call you Saviour
You brought me Hope
When I was lost in my way.
You call me Servant, and i call you Master
I humble myself
And give all to my King

When I'm far 
You bring me near
You hold me close
Erase my fear 
You never let me go

I want to lavish my LOVE on you Jesus 
To sing from my heart, my gratitude
For all you have and continue to do
I'm thankful to know love,
and hear it from You
